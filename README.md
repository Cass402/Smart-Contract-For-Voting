This project is called Smart Contract for Voting.

The objective of this project is to develop a smart contract on Ethereum for a voting system where the votes are transparent and tamper proof.

The project uses Node.js and npm which are essential for working with Ethereum development tools.

The tools that are in use are:

1. Truffle - a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum.
2. Ganache - a personal blockchain for Ethereum development.
3. MetaMask - browser extension for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
